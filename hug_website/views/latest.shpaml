                Introducing: hug 2
            p#introduction
                The first release of hug introduced a succinct and intuitive way of building HTTP REST APIs with Python 3.
                Version 2 brings further improvements to the way HTTP APIs can be created, while also enabling single
                API definitions to be exposed over multiple interfaces. APIs can now be exposed to
                HTTP, the command line, and Python from the same codebase.

                Write once. Use everywhere.
            p
                With hug 2.0.0 your API and business logic is cleanly separated from the interface you're exposing it on, which means you can safely expose it over HTTP, CLI, and Python in one fell swoop.

                Seamless micro-services

            p
                hug 2.0.0 introduces the concept of seamless micro-service communication, which makes it easy
                to switch out pure Python calls for HTTP communication and vice versa.

                Chainable routing
            p
                hug 2.0.0 makes reusing routes easy. Every route object is chainable and doesn't perform
                any actions until it is ran against a function, method, or object.
