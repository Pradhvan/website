  <h1>
    Getting hug set up for local development
  </h1>
  <p>
    The first step when contributing to any project is getting it set up on your local machine. hug aims to make this as simple as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Account Requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/join">
        A valid GitHub account
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Base System Requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Python3.3+
    </li>
    <li>
      Python3-venv (included with most Python3 installations but some Ubuntu systems require that it be installed separately)
    </li>
    <li>
      bash or a bash compatible shell (should be auto-installed on Linux / Mac)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv">
        autoenv
      </a>
      (optional)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once you have verified that you system matches the base requirements you can start to get the project working by following these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug/fork">
        Fork the project on GitHub
      </a>
      .
    </li>
    <li>
      Clone your fork to your local file system:
      <code>
        git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ACCOUNT/hug.git
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>
        cd hug
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have autoenv set-up correctly, simply press Y and then wait for the environment to be set up for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don't have autoenv set-up, run
          <code>
            source .env
          </code>
          to set up the local environment. You will need to run this script every time you want to work on the project - though it will not cause the entire set up process to re-occur.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Run
      <code>
        test
      </code>
      to verify your everything is set up correctly. If the tests all pass, you have successfully set up hug for local development! If not, you can ask for help diagnosing the error
      <a href="https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/hug">
        here
      </a>
      .
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    At step 3, you can skip using autoenv and the
    <code>
      .env
    </code>
    script,
and create your development virtul environment manually instead
using e.g.
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">
      <code>
        python3 -m venv
      </code>
    </a>
    or
    <code>
      mkvirtualenv
    </code>
    (from
    <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
      virtualenvwrapper
    </a>
    ).
  </p>
  <p>
    Install dependencies by running
    <code>
      pip install -r requirements/release.txt
    </code>
    ,
and optional build or development dependencies
by running
    <code>
      pip install -r requirements/build.txt
    </code>
    or
    <code>
      pip install -r requirements/build.txt
    </code>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Install Hug itself with
    <code>
      pip install .
    </code>
    or
    <code>
      pip install -e .
    </code>
    (for editable mode).
This will compile all modules with
    <a href="https://cython.org/">
      Cython
    </a>
    if it's installed in the environment.
You can skip Cython compilation using
    <code>
      pip install --install-option=--without-cython .
    </code>
    (this works with
    <code>
      -e
    </code>
    as well).
